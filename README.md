# Braintumor Detection Using Transfer Learning (Exception.h5)

In several research articles, brain tumor detection is done through the application of Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. 
When these systems are applied to MRI images, brain tumor prediction is done very quickly and greater accuracy helps to deliver treatment to patients.

# Instructions
1) Save the model in .hdf5 format
2) run main.py
